## Local development

This project uses Node.js 24.19.0, managed with `mise`.

```sh
mise install
npm ci
npm run dev
```

The development server is available at http://localhost:3000. Before opening a pull request, run `npm test`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run build`.

Pull requests to `main` run the same lint, test, accessibility, end-to-end, and build checks in the CI workflow with read-only permissions. Only pushes to `main` deploy the site to GitHub Pages.

The accessibility check additionally requires the Chromium system libraries; on Debian/Ubuntu, install them with `npx playwright install --with-deps chromium`.

`npm run test:e2e` runs browser interaction tests for navigation, language, theme, drawers, and the GitHub archive tabs against a mocked GitHub API. It needs the same Chromium setup as the accessibility check.
